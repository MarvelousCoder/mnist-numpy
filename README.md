# Multilayer Perceptron

This repository contains an implementation of a simple MLP using numpy.
Work based on ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning).

It is possible to choose ReLU as activation function now. Also, it is possible
to activate cyclic learning rate (Smith et al. 2017) as learning rate schedule.

There is also a notebook file containing a MLP pytorch's implementation.
